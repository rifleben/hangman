# Hangman
100 days of code challenge, hangman. Using python. Practicing using various while/for loops, creating additional folders, and importing from those folders.

Ways to improve:
- Keep a running tab of all gussed letters in a list:
-   If user attempt to guess a letter they have already used, the program would alert the user and not deduct a life.
